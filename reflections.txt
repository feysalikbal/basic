You've learned a lot about web development so far. 
I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 

Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  
  I have learned to create my first webpage, using HTML. 
  Even small elements like <hr> are very essential in building a webpage.

* What has been easy?
  
  HTML is easy to learn and changes can be seen quickly in the browser.
  Writing HTML code, and editing necessary changes in the code is also easier.

* What has been difficult?
  
  I was stuck in basic things and felt stupid about myself. That's why Understanding to use 
  some basic elements became difficult. Now, i have developed better understanding.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome 
challenges so far?

I divided the problem in small chunks. Then, i worked on each
chunk step by step.
